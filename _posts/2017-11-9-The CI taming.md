I workaround on JENKINS CI and Docker. I want provide automatics builds for a couple platforms: Ubuntu 16.04, Astralinux (1.10, 1.11, 1.11.9) and Windows 10 (MinGW)).

  At the current time I have workable automatics builds for Ubuntu 16.04, Astralinux (1.10, 1.11, 1.11.9) and Windows 10, but under Windows I have problem with deploying.
  
  I hoope that after CI tuning I will be able work on code, because I see now I do Devops and nothing more.
